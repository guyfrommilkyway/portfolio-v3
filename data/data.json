Most recently I've worked at Seaplane Group, a Hong Kong-based startup company, where I've took ownership of the maintenance and development of user-facing features for two company projects. Prior to joining Seaplane Group, I've worked at Highly Succeed Inc., a Philippine-based company offering a diverse range of IT services. During my tenure, I've had the opportunity to co-develop web applications for our private and government clients.",

      "004": "To maintain a work-life balance, you'll often find me engaged in spending quality time with my loyal German Shepherd, Comet, forging a bond while honing our skills together. When not in training mode, my other canine companions, Brew and Latte, eargerly join the mix, creating a playful and vibrant atmosphere. In addition, I occasionally indulge in watching TV series such as SEAL Team, The Big Bang Theory, Suits, etc.. I'm also an enthusiastic gamer with a particular fondness for real-time strategy, single-player campaigns with compelling narratives, and tactical shooter games.",
